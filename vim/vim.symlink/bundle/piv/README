PHP Integration for VIM
Description

This project contains the most feature complete and up to date php integration for vim. It began as a fork of the largely outdated VIP (formerly PDV), but has morphed into it's own project. While the file is located here, development happens on github. http://github.com/spf13/PIV.

It does not include non PHP specific functionality like commenting but rather suggests you use one of the many general purpose plugins that do a great job.. Recommendations provided at the end of this doc.

Features

Syntax updated for PHP 5.3

The list of PHP constants, functions, and classes was updated to be current with PHP 5.3. Many new classes were added in the 5.2 branch and the distributed version only covers up to 5.1.4.

Better Fold Support

This plugin can fold PHP functions and/or classes, properties with their PhpDoc, without manually adding marker style folds ({{{ and }}}) http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1623

Can be turned off by setting

let g:DisableAutoPHPFolding = 1
in your .vimrc file.

PHP Doc Gen

Generate phpDocumentor conforming documentation blocks for your PHP code.

To use place cursor on line with class, function or variable definition and type ,pd (in n mode)

Better Completion

PHP completion script for use with omniComplete.

Completion from current file, tags and php builtin:

* classes (after new), 
* functions  
* variables
* constants 
* language keywords 
After -> and :: options limited to funcs and vars.

Better indenting w/automatic formatting
